Data Science
Situation

In order to make the Xtern program the best summer internship program for the participants, the data science team is focusing its efforts on picking out the most convenient coworking space from a list of 5 potential places and providing a sample 10-week activities plan. A sample 10-week activities plan includes a weekly group dinner at different restaurants around Indianapolis, a biweekly sport, music, gaming, and art event, one big conference or Ted Talk event. 

Your Task

Please look over the data.xlsx for Xtern housing location and 5 coworking spaces location. Utilize the open-source map API such as Google Map API, OpenStreetMap, AWS Map API to collect useful data around restaurants and event venue location.

As an important member of the team, you get to come up with your own analysis and explain it! So try your best to dig out any useful information out of this data set. The sky's the limit! 🤓
